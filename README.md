# ICCU Interview Showcase

Limited scope example test suite, coded in Java using Selenium to showcase my test automation knowledge.

## Description

Interviewing for a new role can be quite the challenge. Afterall, interviewing is not everyone's strongest skillset. When preparing for this role, I thought it would be interesting to build some test automation cases for ICCU's website.
